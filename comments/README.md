# Comment Box React.js/Flux App
This is a simple comment feed application built using React.js and Flux

**Note: This project is currently under construction**

## Building and Running
From the *comments/* directory:

    npm install
    npm run build
    
To view, direct your browser to:

    reactjs-sandbox/comments/index.html

## TODO

 * Hook-in flux to the React components and rip-out JQuery from the view (instead placing it in a store(?))
 * Build using Gulp/Grunt
